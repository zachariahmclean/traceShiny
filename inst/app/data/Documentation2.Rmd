## STEP 2: FIND LADDERS
This step identifies the ladders in the ladder channel which is used to call the base pair size.

-   The ladder peaks are assigned from largest to smallest using the supplied ladder sizes.

-   Base pair sizes are assigned using the local Southern method. Basically, for each data point, linear models are made for the lower and upper 3 size standard and the predicted sizes are averaged. This means that it may not matter if the ladder is miss-assigned far away from you data signal.

-   Each ladder should be manually inspected to make sure that is has been correctly assigned.

#### Select only samples with ladder warnings
Identifies samples with misaligned ladder sizes and ladder peaks. The threshold is dependent on the r-squared threshold for warning.

#### Ladder R-squared Table
Table of R-squared values derived from a linear regression of data signal and size for every 3 consecutive ladder sizes. Values closer to 1 indicate a better fit.

#### Ladder Summary Table
Table of the average and minimum R-squared values of the Ladder R-squared table for each sample.

#### Interactive ladder fixing
If the ladders are are not assigned correctly, you can interactively fix them.
