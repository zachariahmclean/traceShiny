### Tandem Repeat Analysis by Capillary Electrophoresis

This web server is designed to help guide users through a pipeline for short tandem repeat instability analysis from fragment analysis data. The inputs are fsa files and a user supplied metadata data-frame. This is an app version of our R package [trace](https://zachariahmclean.github.io/trace/), that has the following key features with additional interactivity:

-   Processing fsa files (ladder identification, base pair assignment, peak identification).

-   Identifying alleles and calling repeats.

-   Assigning index peaks and calculating instability metrics (e.g. expansion index or average repeat gain)
