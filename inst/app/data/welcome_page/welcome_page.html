<h3>Tandem Repeat Analysis by Capillary Electrophoresis</h3>
<p>This web server is designed to help guide users through a pipeline
for short tandem repeat instability analysis from fragment analysis
data. The inputs are fsa files and a user supplied metadata data-frame.
This is an app version of our R package <a href="https://zachariahmclean.github.io/trace/">trace</a>, that has the
following key features with additional interactivity:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Processing fsa files (ladder identification, base pair
assignment, peak identification).</p></li>
<li><p>Identifying alleles and calling repeats.</p></li>
<li><p>Assigning index peaks and calculating instability metrics
(e.g.Â expansion index or average repeat gain)</p></li>
</ul>
