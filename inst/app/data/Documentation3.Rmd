## STEP 3: FIND PEAKS
In the previous step we processed the raw data, now we need to extract fragment data. That involves finding peaks, finding alleles, and calling repeats.

#### Number of peaks
Total number of called peaks.

#### Modal repeat
The repeat size of the modal peak (tallest peak).

#### Modal signal
The data signal of the modal peak (tallest peak).

#### Allele signal
The data signal of the allele peak (for called alleles).

#### Allele repeat
The repeat size of the allele peak (for called alleles).
